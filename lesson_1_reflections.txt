1. Use diff to find the difference between two files

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I'll know the line of code that was change to fix the bug so that was the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

History tell us what changes have been made. We'll learn more  about new feature, bugs, etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros (manually): you can choose the right time to commit
cons (manually): you might forget to commit so that your commit will be too big.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because some files are related to one another so changes in one file will affect another file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git diff previous_file newer_file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

i can easily go back to old version to check what's wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

try making a program
