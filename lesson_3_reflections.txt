Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: copy from another repositories so we could only change the copy without affecting the original.
clones: copy from remote repositories to local computer so local and remote could share the same commit.
branches: different version from the original or master. we use this to try a new feature, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
we could have all the newest changes locally
