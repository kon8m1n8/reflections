What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I started a repository and a hidden directory .git appear. I need it so i can start add commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is the place that you want to monitor the changes. It contains the files to be monitor.
